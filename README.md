# Deployment Instructions


AZ-104 has been released. We will continue to monitor this repository in the short term, but please consider moving over to the new labs as soon as possible.




# Large Header

> **SOME NOTES.**

> **Microsoft is prioritizing cloud resources for Covid-19 support. You can read more here - [Update #2 on Microsoft cloud services continuity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/update-2-on-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/). There is also an active discussion on the MCT Courseware Forum.**

> **There is a [Lab Recordings and Demos](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Lab-Demo-Recordings) repo with links to videos of labs used in Microsoft Official Curriculum. The intent is to provide Microsoft Certified Trainers an easy way to access a non-audio version recording of hands-on labs used in the portfolio.**



## Medium Header - 


### Small Header - with bullets

- **Bullet 1 - Bold text** - hidden link [MicrosoftLearning/Docker-Build](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Docker-Build) repository
- **Bullet 2** - text
- **Bullet 3** - plain link <https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-103-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/>


### Small Header - with lists

* Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)
* Unordered lists start each item with a `*`
- `-` works too
	* Indent a level to make a nested list
		1. Ordered lists are supported.
		2. Start each item (number-period-space) like `1. `
		42. It doesn't matter what number you use, I will render them sequentially
		1. So you might want to start each line with `1.` and let me sort it out


### Small Header - with table
You can align cell contents with syntax like this:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text |         $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |           $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |            $1 |
